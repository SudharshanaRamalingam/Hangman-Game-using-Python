# Hangman-Game-using-Python
This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game follows the classic rules where the player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. Each incorrect guess brings the player closer to "hanging", with a limited number of attempts to guess the word before the game ends.
